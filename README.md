TITLE:  Smart Mobility Cane for visually impaired persons.


The problem addressed by this smart cane invention is the difficulty faced by people with visual impairments in navigating and interacting with their environment. Traditional canes provide basic support for mobility, but they do not offer any additional assistance for object detection, navigation, or privacy. This smart cane aims to solve these problems by integrating various technologies such as a camera, GPS navigation, real-time object detection, voice assistant, and fingerprint sensor. By doing so, it provides a more comprehensive and convenient solution for people with visual impairments to navigate and interact with their surroundings, improving their independence and overall quality of life. 
Visually impaired people see the objects using the other four senses touch, smell, taste and hearing but they can not use them in every situation. A Smart Mobility cane can help them navigate their environment by providing additional information and alerts, by doing so it facilitates them by being an alternative option in every situation to see objects which ultimately reduces the risk of accidents and enhances their independence.
